# Puppy Potty Data Analysis
For analyzing my puppy's potty data, this repository is created to contain all the data warehouse/ ETL/ SQL/ dashboard development files.

The ETL diagram is shown below. Incremental data is extracted from excel to postgreSQL twice a day using Python and Shell script. The data is transformed analyzed in postgreSQL. Finally, a tableau dashboard is created to visuzlize the potty training result.
